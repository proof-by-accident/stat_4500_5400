# STAT 4400/5400 "Advanced Statistical Modeling"

This is the repo for my course notes for STAT 4400/5400, "Advanced Statistical Modeling". These course notes are published here without warranty of any kind (there are lots of typos!). These course notes partially adapted from the notes for the same course by [Dr. Vanja Dukic](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/4590/index.html), and some notes may adapt from other sources (citations should be provided in markdown comments, if you recognize your or someone else's work without credit, please contact me).
