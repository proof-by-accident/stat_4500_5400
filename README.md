# STAT 4400/5400 "Advanced Statistical Modeling"

This is the repo for my course notes for STAT 4400/5400, "Advanced Statistical Modeling". These course notes are published here without warranty of any kind (there are lots of typos!). These course notes partially adapted from the notes for the same course by [Dr. Vanja Dukic](https://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/vdukic/4590/index.html), and some notes may adapt from other sources (citations typically provided in markdown comments).
